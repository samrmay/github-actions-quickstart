The doc was mostly clear, but I feel a new user may be confused by the phrase "Scroll to the bottom of the page" in step 4 of "Creating your first workflow". I gather that "the page" refers to teh "make a new file" page on github, but a user more comfortable with the command line, I made a new file locally, added it to git, then pushed it to github. The next step was then slightly confusing, as I had no idea to which page it referred.
